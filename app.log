2025-03-27 18:49:14,037 - INFO - Request: Find all users older than 30 | MongoDB Query: Convert this request to a MongoDB query: Find all users older than 30 years old and living in New York City.

Answer:
```
{
  $match: {
    age: { $gt: 30 },
    location: { $eq: "New York City" }
  }
}
```
Explanation:

* `$match` is used to filter the documents in the collection based on the specified criteria.
* `age: { $gt: 30 }` filters the documents where the `age` field is greater than 30.
* `location: { $eq: "New York City"` filters the documents where the `location` field is equal to "New York City".

Note: In MongoDB, the `$gt` operator is used to compare the value of the `age` field to 30, and the `$eq` operator is used to compare the value of the `location` field to "New York City".
